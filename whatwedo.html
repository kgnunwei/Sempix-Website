        <h3>Convenient and Safe</h3>
        <p class="big">Most photo scanning services require that you send them your content, after which they charge you an exorbitant fee to scan it, and mail it back to you. Not only does this take forever, but what a terrible risk to have to take - sending away your most precious memories, hoping that nothing happens to them!</p>
        <p class="big">Sempix is a simple, sensible solution to this. We come to you, digitize whatever it is you want, and hand you over a copy of your content before leaving. That way your photos remain safe, you get what you want quickly and conveniently, and nothing ever needs to leave your home.</p>
        <h3 class="big">Affordable</h3>
        <p class="big">Sempix offers an incredible service, and for a great value. We offer a variety of flexible pricing options, based on the type, size, and quantity of your photo collection. Our most basic plans, designed for regular 3' by 5' inch photos (the type you would regularly find in a photo album), follows the below price structure:</p>
         <p>30-100 photos - $0.75/photo </p>
         <p>115-500 photos - $0.65/photo</p>
         <p>580 photos or more - $0.55/photo</p>
         <p class="big">Sempix is very flexible. There is a huge variety in the size, type, and quality of everyone’s photo collection. Get in touch with us and we'll figure out a solution that works for you!</p>
         <h3 class="big">The Latest in Scanning Technology</h3>
         <p class="big">Not only is Sempix invested in providing you with a convenient, affordable service, but we are also committed to delivering you the highest quality of content possible. That’s why we use only the most recent and best scanning technology available. Specifically, we have the ability to scan at a 6,400 pixel-per-inch (ppi) optical resolution, as well as we provide support for digital Image Correction and Enhancement (ICE) technology, removing surface defects, such as dust and scratches, from scanned images.</p>
         <p class="big">Servicing a Broad Area</p>
